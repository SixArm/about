# Inherent risk

Inherent risk, also known as inherent risk exposure, refers to the level of risk or vulnerability that exists in a process, activity, or business environment before any control measures are implemented. It represents the risk inherent in a particular situation or operation, assuming there are no mitigating controls or risk management measures in place.

Key pointsâ€¦

Nature of Risk: Consider factors such as the complexity of the process, the sensitivity of the information involved, the potential impact of the risk event, and the likelihood of its occurrence.

Control Absence: Represent the risk level before considering any controls that may be implemented to reduce or mitigate the risk. Understand the magnitude of the risk exposure and the potential consequences.

Risk Assessment: Identify and prioritize risks based on their inherent characteristics. Provide a foundation for implementing appropriate control measures to mitigate or manage the identified risks.

Risk Evaluation: Analyzing the potential impact and likelihood of risks to determine their significance and prioritize risk management efforts. Focus on risks that pose the most significant threats.

Risk Management: Determine the appropriate level of controls and risk mitigation strategies necessary to reduce the inherent risk to an acceptable level. Implement targeted risk management actions.

Dynamic Nature: Monitor inherent risk over time, because factors such as environmental changes, new technologies, regulatory developments, or market shifts can alter risks and organizational risk appetite.
