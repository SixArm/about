# BANT-qualified sales leads

Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline (BANT) is a framework used in sales and marketing to assess the quality and potential of a sales opportunity. The BANT criteria help determine whether a lead is likely to convert into a successful sale.

Budget: Does the lead have the financial resources to make a purchase? Understanding the prospect's budget ensures that their financial capacity aligns with the product or service being offered. It helps identify whether they can afford the solution and prevents wasting time on leads that may not be able to make a purchase.

Authority: Who are the people within the lead's organization who have decision-making power? It is important to establish contact with individuals who can authorize a purchase or influence the decision-making process. Engaging with decision-makers increases the chances of closing a deal successfully.

Need: Does the lead have a genuine requirement for the product or service? It involves understanding the pain points, challenges, or goals that the lead is trying to address or achieve. Assessing the lead's needs helps determine the relevance of the offering and whether it can provide a solution or value to them.

Timeline: What is the lead's expected timeframe for making a purchase? It helps identify whether the lead has an urgent need or if the purchase decision will be made in the future. Understanding the timeline is crucial for prioritizing and planning sales efforts effectively.
