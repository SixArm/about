# Innovation partnership fails because…

Innovation partnerships can fail for various reasons…

Misaligned Goals: When oartners have different expectations or incompatible visions for the partnership, it can lead to diverging interests and conflicting priorities. 

Lack of Collaboration: Poor communication, lack of transparency, or insufficient sharing of information can lead to misunderstandings, delays, and a breakdown in the partnership.

Power Imbalances: If there are significant power imbalances between the partners, it erode trust, cause frustration and hinder the collaborative spirit necessary for success.

Incompatible Working Styles: When the partners have conflicting approaches to problem-solving, decision-making, or risk-taking, it can lead to difficulties in reaching consensus.

Insufficient Resources: If partners fail to commit the necessary resources or if resource allocations are inadequate, it can impede the partnership's ability to execute.

Lack of Trust: Lack of trust in each other's capabilities, intentions, or reliability, may lead to a lack of investment, limited engagement, poor collaboration, and eventual failure.

Intellectual Property Issues: Uncertainties around intellectual property rights, ownership, or licensing terms can lead to disputes and legal complications that jeopardize success.

Lack of Flexibility: If the partners are rigid in their approaches, resistant to change, or unwilling to adapt their strategies based on new information or feedback, it can limit success.

Poor Governance: Lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities, inadequate project management practices, or ineffective decision-making processes, can lead to delays and inefficiencies.

Lack of a Shared Learning Culture: If the partners do not prioritize learning from failures, sharing insights, and applying lessons learned, it can limit the ability to innovate and adapt.
