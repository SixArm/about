# Runbook

A runbook, also known as an operations manual or playbook, is a document or collection of documents that provides detailed instructions and information on how to handle and resolve various operational tasks, incidents, or processes within an organization. It serves as a reference guide for the operations team to follow when managing day-to-day operations, troubleshooting issues, or responding to incidents. Benefits include consistency, efficiency, knowledge transfer, standardization, incident response, improved training, greater continuity, and faster disaster recovery.

**Key aspects:**

* **Purpose**: The runbook should clearly state its purpose and the specific operational tasks or processes it covers.

* **Instructions**: Runbooks provide detailed procedures and step-by-step instructions for executing tasks or resolving issues. The steps should be clear, concise, and easy to follow. The instructions may include flowcharts, decision trees, or checklists.

* **Dependencies**: Runbooks should outline whatever dependencies, necessities, and prerequisites need to be met before executing a particular task.

* **Responding**: For incident management, runbooks provide instructions for responding to specific types of incidents, including containment, analysis, mitigation, and recovery steps.

* **Communication and Escalation**: Runbooks may include guidelines on how to communicate with stakeholders, including how to escalate issues to higher levels of support if necessary.
