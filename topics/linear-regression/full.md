# Linear regression

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (also known as the target or outcome variable) and one or more independent variables (also known as predictor or feature variables). The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting linear relationship that can predict the dependent variable based on the independent variables.

In its simplest form, linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables $X$ and the dependent variable $Y$ and is represented by the equation:

$Y=β_0+β_1X+ε$

Where:

* $Y$ is the dependent variable (target).
* $X$ is the independent variable (feature).
* $β_0$ is the intercept term (the value of $Y$ when $X$ is 0).
* $β_1$ is the coefficient of the independent variable $X$ (the slope of the line).
* $ε$ is the error term representing the difference between the predicted value and the actual value of $Y$.

The goal of linear regression is to estimate the values of β0β0​ and β1β1​ such that the predicted values of YY are as close as possible to the actual values. This is typically done by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values, which is known as the "least squares" criterion.

Linear regression can be extended to handle multiple independent variables, resulting in multiple linear regression:

$Y=β_0+β_1X_1+β_2X_2+…+β_pX_p+ε$

* $X_1,X_2,…,X_p$ are the different independent variables
* $β_1,β_2,…,β_p$ are the different independent variables' respective coefficients.

Linear regression has a wide range of applications, including:

* Predictive modeling: Making predictions about future outcomes based on historical data.
* Relationship modeling: Analyzing and quantifying the relationship between variables.
* Regression analysis: Assessing the effect of independent variables on the dependent variable.
* Hypothesis testing: Evaluating the significance of variables in explaining variation in the dependent variable.

It's important to note that linear regression assumes a linear relationship between variables, and its performance may be limited when the underlying relationship is more complex. In such cases, other regression techniques like polynomial regression or nonlinear regression might be more appropriate.
