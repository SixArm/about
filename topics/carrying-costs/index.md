# Carrying costs

Carrying costs, also known as holding costs, are the expenses that a company incurs to hold and maintain its inventory over a period of time. Carrying costs can be a significant expense for businesses, particularly those with large or slow-moving inventory.

**Examples:**

* **Storage costs**: e.g. renting or owning a warehouse or storage space to hold inventory.

* **Insurance costs**: e.g. insuring inventory against theft, damage, or other risks.

* **Maintenance costs**: e.g. cleaning, repairing, or updating products to prevent obsolescence.

* **Taxes**: e.g. cost of property taxes and other taxes related to holding inventory.

* **Opportunity cost**: e.g. tying up capital in inventory that could have been invested in other areas, such as research and development, marketing, or expansion.

**Examples to reduce carrying costs:**

* **Improve inventory management**: By implementing better inventory management practices, such as forecasting demand, improving order accuracy, and reducing lead times, businesses can reduce the amount of inventory they need to hold, which can help to lower carrying costs.

* **Negotiate supplier terms**: By negotiating better terms with suppliers, such as longer payment terms or discounts for early payment, businesses can reduce the amount of capital tied up in inventory, which can help to reduce carrying costs.
