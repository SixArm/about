# Onboarding and offboarding

In busisness, "onboarding" and "offboarding" refer to two distinct processes related to managing employees.

Onboarding, also known as employee orientation, is the process of integrating a new employee into the company and its culture. It typically occurs when a new employee joins the organization and continues for a specific duration, usually the first few weeks or months of employment. The goal of onboarding is to familiarize the new employee with their role, responsibilities, company policies, procedures, and organizational values. It also aims to help the employee build relationships with colleagues and understand the company's expectations.

Onboarding practices typically include orientation sessions, training and guidance, provisioning of systems, introductions to colleagues, and signing necessary paperwork.

Offboarding, also known as employee separation or exit process, occurs when an employee leaves the company. It involves managing the transition and ensuring a smooth departure for the employee. Offboarding processes vary depending on the reason for separation, whether it is due to resignation, retirement, termination, or the end of a contract.

Offboarding practices typically include exit interviews, collecting company property, terminating access to company systems, administering final payroll, communicating the departure to stakeholders, transition of the employee's responsibilities, and sharing information about post-employment benefits.
