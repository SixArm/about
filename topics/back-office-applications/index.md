# Back-office applications 

Front-office applications and back-office applications are two categories of software systems used in organization. Front-office applications focus on customer interactions and revenue generation, while back-office applications handle internal operations and administrative tasks.

* A back-office application is software that supports internal operations and administrative functions within an organization. 

* It focuses on tasks and processes that are not directly visible to customers but are essential for the smooth functioning of the business.

* Back-office applications are often used by employees in departments such as finance, human resources, accounting, and operations.

Characteristics:

* Internal-Facing: Back-office applications are used by employees within the organization rather than by external customers.

* Data Processing and Management: They handle tasks related to data processing, storage, reporting, and analysis, supporting internal operations and decision-making.

* Automation and Workflow Management: Back-office applications automate repetitive tasks, streamline workflows, and improve efficiency within departments.

* Security and Access Control: Due to handling sensitive information, back-office applications often incorporate robust security measures and access controls to protect data and ensure compliance.

* Integration with Enterprise Systems: They integrate with other internal systems and databases, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems or payroll systems, to exchange data and streamline processes.

Examples:

* Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems: These applications manage various aspects of business operations, including finance, inventory, procurement, and human resources.

* Accounting software: These applications handle financial transactions, bookkeeping, and reporting.

* Human Resources Information Systems (HRIS): These applications manage employee data, payroll, benefits, and performance management.

* Supply Chain Management systems: These applications facilitate the management of the supply chain, including inventory, procurement, and logistics.
