# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network architecture designed to process sequential data by maintaining an internal state or memory. Unlike feedforward neural networks, where information flows only in one direction from input to output, RNNs allow information to be propagated in a loop, allowing the network to retain information about past inputs.

The main characteristic of RNNs is their ability to handle sequential data of varying lengths, making them well-suited for tasks where the order and context of the data are essential. Some examples of applications for RNNs include natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, time series prediction, and handwriting recognition.

Key featuresâ€¦

Recurrent Connections: RNNs have recurrent connections that form loops, allowing information from previous time steps to be passed on to the current time step. This allows the network to maintain memory of past inputs and use that information to make predictions or decisions.

Hidden State or Memory: RNNs have an internal hidden state or memory, which is updated at each time step based on the current input and the previous hidden state. The hidden state encodes information about the context and history of the sequence up to the current time step.

Vanishing and Exploding Gradient: A challenge in training RNNs is the vanishing or exploding gradient problem, where gradients can become extremely small or large during backpropagation through time. This issue can lead to difficulties in learning long-range dependencies in the data.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU): To address the vanishing gradient problem and better capture long-term dependencies, variants of RNNs such as LSTM and GRU have been introduced. These models have specialized gating mechanisms that help control the flow of information in the network.

Sequence-to-Sequence Models: RNNs are commonly used in sequence-to-sequence models, where the input sequence is transformed into another sequence of variable length. Such models are widely used in machine translation, text generation, and speech synthesis.
