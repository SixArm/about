# Machine learning parameters

In machine learning, parameters are variables that are learned from the training data during the training process. These parameters define the characteristics of the model and its decision boundaries, allowing the model to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. The specific parameters depend on the type of machine learning algorithm being used.

Examplesâ€¦

Linear Regression:

* Intercept (bias): A constant term added to the linear equation.
* Coefficients (weights): Weights assigned to each feature in the input data.

Logistic Regression:

* Intercept (bias): A constant term added to the logistic equation.
* Coefficients (weights): Weights assigned to each feature in the input data.

Support Vector Machines (SVM):

* Kernel parameters: Parameters that define the kernel function used to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space.
* Regularization parameter (C): Controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors.

Decision Trees:

* Split criteria: Criteria for determining how to split the data at each node in the tree (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy).
* Maximum depth: The maximum depth of the tree, which controls its complexity and potential for overfitting.

Random Forest:

* Number of trees: The number of individual decision trees in the forest.
* Maximum depth: The maximum depth of each decision tree in the forest.

Neural Networks:

* Weights and biases: Parameters that define the connections between the neurons in the network.
* Learning rate: Controls the step size in the optimization process during training.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

* Number of neighbors (K): The number of nearest neighbors used to make predictions.
* Distance metric: The metric used to measure the distance between data points.
