# Balanced tree (b-tree)

A balanced tree (b-tree) is a self-balancing, tree-like data structure that maintains sorted data and provides efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. b-trees are commonly used in databases and file systems because of their balanced structure and ability to handle large datasets efficiently.

Key aspectsâ€¦

Balanced Structure: b-trees are designed to be self-balancing. This means that the height of the tree is kept as balanced as possible, ensuring that operations like insertion and deletion are performed in logarithmic time.

Order: A b-tree has a parameter known as its "order" or "degree" (often denoted as "t"). The order of a b-tree determines the maximum number of children a node can have. Typically, a b-tree node can have between `t-1` and `2t-1` keys.

Sorted Keys: Keys within each node are sorted in ascending order. This allows for efficient searching using binary search within a node.

Child Pointers: Each non-leaf node has one more child pointer than the number of keys. These child pointers guide the traversal of the tree.

Root Node: The root node is the topmost node in the b-tree. Initially, the root node may have fewer keys than allowed by the order, but as keys are inserted, it may split into two nodes.

Leaf Nodes: All leaf nodes are at the same level and contain data entries. They have no children, and they can have between t-1 and 2t-1 keys.

Node Splitting: When a node exceeds its maximum allowed number of keys, it is split into two nodes, and the median key is promoted to the parent node.

Node Merging: When a node has fewer than t-1 keys after a deletion, it can borrow keys from a sibling node or merge with a sibling node to maintain balance.

Traversal: b-trees support in-order traversal, which allows efficient retrieval of all keys in sorted order.
