# Progressive enhancement

Progressive enhancement is an approach to web or user interface (UI) design and development that focuses on delivering a basic, functional experience to all users while progressively adding enhanced features and functionality for those with more advanced or capable devices.

The core principle of progressive enhancement is to start with a solid foundation that works on a wide range of devices, browsers, and user contexts, and then build upon it to provide additional features and experiences for users who have more capable devices or modern technologies.

Key conceptsâ€¦

Core Functionality: Ensure that the core functionality of the UI or website is accessible and usable by all users. This includes ensuring proper semantic markup, basic navigation, and support for essential features that work across different devices and browsers.

Layered Enhancements: Add layers of enhancements on top of the core functionality. These enhancements can include additional styling, interactivity, animations, advanced features, or performance optimizations. Each layer is designed to enhance the user experience but is not essential for the basic functionality of the UI.

Device and Context Independence: Ensure that the UI works well on a variety of devices, including older browsers, smaller screens, or limited bandwidth connections. It takes into account different user contexts, such as varying input methods (mouse, touch, keyboard), screen sizes, or accessibility needs.

Graceful Degradation: Follow the principle of graceful degradation, which means that if a user's device or browser does not support certain enhancements, the core functionality remains intact, and the UI still functions as expected. This ensures that all users can access the essential content and features, regardless of their device capabilities.

Flexibility: By building a UI in a progressively enhanced manner, it becomes more flexible and adaptable to future changes in technology. New features or enhancements can be easily added on top of the existing foundation without compromising the core functionality.

Accessibility: Promote accessibility by focusing on the core functionality and ensuring that users with different abilities can access and interact with the UI. It allows for the implementation of accessible design practices and provides a more inclusive user experience.
