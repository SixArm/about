# Jobs to be Done (JTBD)

Jobs to be Done (JTBD) is a framework and theory that focuses on understanding the underlying motivations and goals that drive consumers to purchase and use products or services. It emphasizes the idea that customers "hire" products or services to get a job done, rather than simply buying them based on their features or attributes.

The core concept of Jobs to be Done is that customers have specific goals, problems, or needs they want to address or fulfill, and they look for solutions that will help them achieve those outcomes. The "job" refers to the progress or outcome that customers are trying to make in a particular circumstance or situation.

Key principlesâ€¦

* Focus on Customer Motivations: Rather than focusing solely on demographic or psychographic characteristics, JTBD focuses on understanding the underlying motivations and goals that drive customers' decision-making processes. It seeks to uncover the desired outcomes or improvements customers are seeking.

* Contextual Understanding: JTBD emphasizes understanding the specific context in which customers are trying to achieve a particular job. This includes understanding the circumstances, constraints, and challenges customers face during the job execution process.

* Outcome-Oriented Thinking: JTBD encourages thinking in terms of outcomes or progress customers want to achieve, rather than focusing on the specific features or attributes of a product. By understanding the desired outcomes, organizations can design products or services that align with customers' needs more effectively.

* Market Segmentation: JTBD suggests that customers with different jobs to be done may have different needs and preferences. By identifying distinct jobs and segmenting the market based on those jobs, organizations can tailor their offerings to specific customer segments more effectively.

* Iterative Improvement: The Jobs to be Done framework emphasizes continuous learning and improvement. Organizations should continually seek feedback and insights from customers to refine and enhance their products or services to better address the jobs customers are trying to accomplish.

The Jobs to be Done framework can be applied through various research methods, including interviews, surveys, and observational studies. By using these methods, organizations can uncover the true motivations and desired outcomes of their customers, leading to more customer-centric product development and marketing strategies.

By understanding the jobs customers are trying to accomplish, organizations can better identify opportunities for innovation, develop solutions that meet customer needs more effectively, and differentiate themselves in the marketplace. The Jobs to be Done framework provides a valuable lens through which organizations can understand customer behavior and make informed decisions to drive customer satisfaction and business success.
