Incident Response: Help identify the affected systems, determine the extent of the compromise, the potential root causes and origins, and facilitate remediation efforts.

Monitoring and Alerting: Detect abnormal activities or potential security threats. Continuously analyze data to identify patterns, anomalies, or deviations from expected behaviors, then trigger alerts.

Performance and Usage Analysis: Analyze system performance, resource utilization, and user behavior. Identify areas of improvement, optimize resource allocation, track system usage trends, aid in capacity planning, and enhance overall efficiency.
