# Binary search algorithm

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a specific target element within a sorted list or array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, eliminating half of the remaining elements at each step. 

Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This means it has a much faster runtime than linear search, especially for large datasets. However, it requires that the input data be sorted.

Steps:

1. Start with the entire sorted list or array.

2. Find the middle element of the current search interval.

3. Compare the middle element to the target element you are searching for.

4. If the middle element is equal to the target element, the search is successful, and you can return the index of the middle element (or any other relevant information).

5. If the middle element is greater than the target element, eliminate the right half of the current search interval (since the target must be in the left half of the sorted list).

6. If the middle element is less than the target element, eliminate the left half of the current search interval (since the target must be in the right half of the sorted list).

7. Repeat until you either find the target element or the search interval becomes empty (indicating that the element is not in the list).
