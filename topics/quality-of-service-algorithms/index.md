# Quality of Service (QoS) Algorithms

Quality of Service (QoS) algorithms and mechanisms are essential in computer networking and telecommunications to ensure that network services meet specific performance and reliability requirements. QoS algorithms and techniques are used to prioritize, manage, and control network traffic, allowing for better service delivery, especially in environments where multiple applications with different requirements share the same network infrastructure. 

Some common ones:

* Differentiated Services (DiffServ): Mark packets with Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs) in the IP header, so routers and switches can use these markings to classify and prioritize packets.

* Integrated Services (IntServ): Set up end-to-end service guarantees for data flows. It uses the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) to reserve network resources and provide guaranteed bandwidth and low latency.

* Traffic Shaping: Regulate the rate at which packets are transmitted, such as to smooth out bursty traffic, or and adhere to defined bandwidth limits, preventing network congestion.

* Queue Management Algorithms: Prioritize and manage packet queues. Common algorithms include Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ), Stochastic Fairness Queuing (SFQ), and Random Early Detection (RED).

* Admission Control: Admission control mechanisms assess whether new traffic flows can be admitted into the network without violating QoS agreements. 

* Packet Classification and Marking: These techniques are used to classify incoming packets based on specific criteria, such as source or destination IP addresses, port numbers, or DSCP values.

* Congestion Avoidance: Monitor network conditions and adjust traffic behavior to prevent congestion. These include Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control algorithms, such as TCP Vegas and TCP Cubic.

* Bandwidth Reservation: Allocate a specific amount of network bandwidth to critical applications or services. For example, RSVP can be used to reserve bandwidth for multimedia applications.

* Scheduling Algorithms: Determine the order in which packets are transmitted from queues. Algorithms like Weighted Round Robin and Priority Queuing are used to prioritize certain types of traffic.

* Network Traffic Prioritization: This involves giving preferential treatment to specific types of traffic, such as voice or video, to ensure low latency and jitter.
