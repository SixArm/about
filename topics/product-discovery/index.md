# Product discovery

Product discovery is the process by which startups identify, define, and refine the features and functions of their product or service. The goal is to create a product that solves a real problem for customers and is easy and intuitive to use.

1. **Identify the problem**: What does your product solve? This may involve conducting market research, talking to potential customers, or analyzing existing solutions in the market.

2. **Define user personas:**. User personas are fictional representations of your ideal customers, and they can help you understand the needs, goals, and pain points of your target audience.

3. **Brainstorm potential solutions to the problem**: Taking into account the needs and goals of your user personas. Consider different approaches and features that could solve the problem. Evaluate each solution based on its feasibility, desirability, and viability.

4. **Prioritize features and functions**: What do users want in your product? This may involve conducting more user research to understand your target audience, or using a prioritization framework such as the MoSCoW method.

5. **Create prototypes**: Test with potential customers. This may involve low-fidelity wireframes or mockups, or developing a high-fidelity working prototype of your product.

6. **Iterate**: Interact with potential customers, and gather feedback on your product's usability, functionality, and appeal. Use the feedback to refine your product.

7. **Develop a product roadmap**: Once you have a clear understanding of your product's features and functionality, develop a product roadmap with milestones, timelines, priorities, and features.
