# Startup entrances

Startup entrances refer to the various ways entrepreneurs and early-stage companies enter the startup ecosystem.

**Typical approaches:**

* **Incubators**: These are programs for early stage startups. They can provide workspace, mentorship, networking opportunities, and access to general administrative services. Incubators typically accept startups at ideation, and help them refine business models, validate ideas, and prepare for market entry.

* **Accelerators**: These are programs that speed up startup growth. They can offer a structured curriculum, mentorship, funding, and access to a network of investors, industry experts, and potential customers. Accelerators focus on rapid scaling and achieving milestones within a defined timeframe, often 3-6 months.

* **Skunkworks**: These are in-house highly autonomous innovation teams within a larger organization. Skunkworks explore disruptive ideas independent of the organization's regular processes and bureaucracy. This fosters innovation and entrepreneurial thinking.

* **Spinoffs and spinouts**: These refer to the creation of a new independent company from within an existing organization. A spinoff is when a parent company deliberately separates a division, project, unit, or the like. A spinout is when parent company employees choose to leave to start their own company. The new company has its own management, capital, and strategy.

* **Technology Transfers**: These involve the creation of a new company based on intellectual property (IP) developed within a research institution, then licensed externally. Technology transfers typically occur when an innovation has commercial potential by creating new startup using the IP and the researchers' expertise.
