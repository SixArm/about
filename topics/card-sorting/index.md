# Card sorting

Card sorting is a user research technique used in information architecture and user experience design to understand how users categorize and organize information. It involves participants organizing predefined content or concepts into groups or categories that make sense to them. The goal of a card sorting exercise is to gain insights into users' mental models and understand how they perceive and structure information.

Here's how a typical card sorting exercise works:

1. Preparation: The researcher prepares a set of cards, each containing a single concept, item, or piece of information. These cards can be physical cards or digital representations.

2. Participant Instructions: Participants are given instructions on how to perform the card sorting exercise. They are typically told to group or categorize the cards based on their own understanding, without any specific rules or constraints.

3. Card Sorting Methods: There are two main types of card sorting methods:

  * Open Card Sorting: In open card sorting, participants create their own categories and group the cards based on their own perceptions and organizational principles. They may also provide labels or names for the categories they create.

  * Closed Card Sorting: In closed card sorting, participants are provided with predefined categories or labels and asked to sort the cards into these predetermined groups. This method is useful when testing an existing information architecture or evaluating the effectiveness of predefined categories.

4. Data Collection: The researcher observes and takes notes on how participants group the cards, the rationale behind their categorization decisions, and any challenges or patterns that emerge during the process. This data provides insights into how users perceive relationships between concepts and how they mentally organize information.

5. Analysis: After the card sorting exercise, the researcher analyzes the collected data. This may involve identifying common groupings or patterns among participants, examining the consistency or variations in categorization, and extracting insights to inform the design of information architecture, navigation menus, or content organization.

Card sorting exercises can be conducted with a small group of participants or with a larger sample, depending on the scope of the research and the goals of the study. The results of a card sorting exercise help inform the organization and structure of information in a way that aligns with users' mental models and improves the overall usability and findability of a website, application, or other information systems.

Card sorting can be conducted in-person, remotely, or through specialized card sorting software that allows participants to perform the exercise online. The choice of method depends on the research goals, participant availability, and logistical considerations.
