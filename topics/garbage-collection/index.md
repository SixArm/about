# Garbage collection

Garbage collection is a critical aspect of memory management in computer science and software development. It refers to the automatic process of identifying and reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use or reachable by the program. The primary goal of garbage collection is to free up memory resources, prevent memory leaks, and ensure efficient utilization of available memory.

Key aspectsâ€¦

Memory Allocation and Deallocation: In programming languages, memory is allocated for objects or data structures dynamically at runtime. When an object is no longer needed, its memory should be deallocated to prevent memory leaks.

Manual Memory Management: In languages like C and C++, developers are responsible for manually allocating and deallocating memory using functions like malloc and free. This manual approach is error-prone and can lead to memory-related bugs.

Automatic Garbage Collection: Many modern programming languages, including Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript, employ automatic garbage collection. This means that the language runtime or virtual machine automatically manages memory, identifying and reclaiming unused memory for the developer.

Reachability Analysis: Garbage collectors typically use reachability analysis to determine which objects are still accessible by the program. Objects that are not reachable, directly or indirectly, are considered garbage.

Garbage Collection Algorithms: Various garbage collection algorithms exist, including reference counting, mark-and-sweep, generational, and copying collectors. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, depending on the specific requirements of the programming language or runtime.

Garbage Collection Triggers: Garbage collection can be triggered based on factors like memory pressure, the number of allocated objects, or specific time intervals.

Garbage Collection Overhead: While garbage collection automates memory management, it comes with a performance cost, including increased runtime overhead and occasionally unpredictable pauses.
