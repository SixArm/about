# Discrete outcome

A discrete outcome, also known as a categorical or qualitative outcome, is a type of outcome in statistics that can only take on a specific set of distinct values. These values are often labels or categories representing different groups or characteristics.

In contrast to continuous outcomes, which can take on any value within a specific range (e.g., height, weight, temperature), discrete outcomes have a limited and separate set of possibilities. The values are typically counted and reported as frequencies or percentages within each category.

**Examples:**

* **Coin toss**: can only be "heads" or "tails."

* **Number of children in a family**: can be 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.

* **Types of vehicles on a road**: can be "car", "bus", "truck", etc.

* **Survey response choices**: can be one in a category such as "age group" or "education level" or "tax bracket".

Discrete outcomes are often analyzed using specific statistical methods, such as chi-square tests or logistic regression, depending on the research question and data characteristics. These methods are tailored to handle categorical data and draw conclusions about the relationships between different categories or groups.
