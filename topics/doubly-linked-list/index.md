# Doubly-linked list

A doubly-linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element (node) has a value and two pointers or references, one pointing to the previous node and one pointing to the next node. 

This bidirectional linking allows for efficient traversal in both directions, making it useful for operations that involve forward and backward traversal, such as inserting and deleting elements in the middle of the list. 

Doubly-linked lists are used in various applications, including building data structures like deques and linked lists with iterator support.
