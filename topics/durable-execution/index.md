# Durable execution

Durable execution is the ability of a program or process to continue functioning, and can withstand challenges, including hardware failures, software bugs, network issues, and high demand.

**Key aspects**:

* **Fault Tolerance**: Use failover mechanisms, such as deploying multiple instances of critical components, and implementing automated recovery procedures.

* **Error Handling**: Detect and gracefully recover from errors or unexpected conditions. This includes logging,  informative error messages, and retry logic for transient failures.

* **Scalability**: Scale horizontally or vertically to handle increases in workload or demand. This may involve using distributed architectures, load balancing, and auto-scaling capabilities.

* **Data Integrity**: Ensure the integrity and consistency of data. This includes implementing data validation, error correction mechanisms, and transactional guarantees.

* **Monitoring**: Use monitoring and alerting to detect performance issues, resource constraints, or other anomalies that could impact system reliability.

* **Testing**: Test extreme conditions, such as high load, network partitions, and hardware failures, to ensure resilience and reliability.
