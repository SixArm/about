# Hooked by Nir Eyal

"Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products" by Nir Eyal is a book that explores the psychology and techniques behind creating products that form strong user habits. The book provides a framework called the Hook Model, which consists of four stages—Trigger, Action, Variable Reward, and Investment—to create and reinforce user habits.

Here's a brief overview of each stage in the Hook Model:

* Trigger: Triggers prompt users to take action. Triggers can be external (such as notifications or emails) or internal (internal thoughts or emotions) and can be further classified as either external or internal triggers.

* Action: The action phase refers to the behavior users take in response to the trigger. It should be simple, easy, and frictionless to encourage users to complete the desired action.

* Variable Reward: Variable rewards are an essential element in creating habits. By providing users with rewards that are unpredictable or varied, such as social validation or personalized content, users become more motivated to engage with the product repeatedly.

* Investment: The investment phase involves users investing time, effort, data, or personalization into the product. This investment increases the likelihood of returning to the product in the future.

Through the Hook Model, Nir Eyal offers insights and strategies to create habit-forming products by leveraging psychological triggers and reinforcing user behaviors. The book provides practical examples, case studies, and actionable advice for product designers, entrepreneurs, and anyone interested in understanding the psychology of user habits.

It's important to note that while "Hooked" provides valuable insights into building habit-forming products, it also raises ethical considerations around user manipulation and addiction. It's crucial to use this knowledge responsibly and with a user-centered approach that prioritizes user well-being and value.
