# Quadratic sort algorithm

A quadratic sort algorithm is a class of sort algorithms. They are relatively easy to understand and implement. Two common examples are bubble sort and insertion sort. 

A quadratic sort algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements to be sorted; this is generally poor for sorting large datasets. 

* Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

* Insertion Sort is another simple sorting algorithm that builds the sorted part of the list one element at a time. It takes each element from the unsorted portion of the list and inserts it into its correct position within the sorted part of the list. Here's how it works:

Both Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort are simple to understand and implement but are inefficient for large datasets compared to more advanced sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, or Heap Sort, which have better average-case and worst-case time complexities.
