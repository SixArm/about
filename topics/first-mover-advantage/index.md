# First-mover advantage

First-mover advantage is a business strategy concept that refers to the competitive advantage a company gains by being the first to enter a market or introduce a new product or service. The first mover has the opportunity to establish brand recognition, build customer loyalty, and capture a significant share of the market before competitors.

**Advantages:**

* **Set the standards for the market**: By introducing a new product or service, the first mover can shape customer expectations and create a brand that is associated with innovation and leadership. This can lead to a higher level of customer loyalty, as customers may be more likely to remain loyal to a brand that they perceive as being at the forefront of the market.

* **Establish relationships before competitors**: Connecting with suppliers and distributors, before competitors can, helps secure better pricing and terms for the company, and helps ensure a more reliable supply chain. Additionally, by having established relationships with key suppliers and distributors, the first mover can make it more difficult for competitors to enter the market, as they may face greater barriers to entry.

**Risks:**

* **The market may not be ready**: The company may face significant obstacles in trying to establish a customer base. Additionally, being a first mover often requires significant investment in research and development, marketing, and distribution, which can be a significant financial burden.

* **Competitors are able to learn**: Competitors can analyze the first mover's results, then leverage the analyses to enter markets with lower costs, better products, or more effective marketing, and may be able to capture market share from the first mover.
