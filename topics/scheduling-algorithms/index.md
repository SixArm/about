# Scheduling algorithms

Scheduling algorithms are used to efficiently allocate resources or manage tasks in various computer and operating system-related contexts. These algorithms are essential for optimizing resource utilization, improving system performance, and ensuring fair and timely execution of tasks. Here are some commonly used scheduling algorithms in different domains:

CPU Scheduling Algorithms (Operating Systems):

* First-Come, First-Served (FCFS): Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the queue. It's a non-preemptive algorithm, and the first process to arrive gets the CPU first.

* Shortest Job First (SJF): The CPU is allocated to the process with the shortest execution time. It can be either preemptive (selects the shortest job at the front of the queue) or non-preemptive (selects the shortest job when the CPU is available).

* Round Robin (RR): Each process is given a fixed time slice (time quantum) in a cyclic order. If a process doesn't complete within its time slice, it's moved to the back of the queue.

* Priority Scheduling: Processes are assigned priorities, and the CPU is allocated to the highest priority process. It can be either preemptive (selects the highest-priority process dynamically) or non-preemptive (selects the highest-priority process when the CPU is available).

* Multilevel Queue Scheduling: Processes are divided into multiple priority levels, each with its own scheduling algorithm. Processes are executed based on their priority.

* Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling: Similar to multilevel queue scheduling but allows processes to move between queues based on their behavior, adjusting their priorities dynamically.

Disk Scheduling Algorithms (I/O Systems):

* First-Come, First-Served (FCFS): I/O requests are serviced in the order they arrive. Simple but can lead to long seek times for some requests.

* Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF): The disk arm moves to the track that is closest to its current position, reducing seek time. However, it may lead to starvation of some requests.

* SCAN (Elevator) Scheduling: The disk arm moves in one direction (e.g., toward the outermost track) until it reaches the end and then reverses direction. This reduces the waiting time for requests.

* C-SCAN Scheduling: Similar to SCAN, but the arm moves in one direction only and "wraps around" when it reaches the end, minimizing seek time.

* LOOK Scheduling: The disk arm moves only until it finds the requested track and then reverses direction. It avoids the extra movement of SCAN and C-SCAN.

Task Scheduling Algorithms (Task and Job Scheduling):

* First-Come, First-Served (FCFS): Tasks or jobs are executed in the order they arrive in the queue.

* Shortest Job First (SJF): Tasks are executed based on their estimated execution times, starting with the shortest.

* Round Robin (RR): Tasks are allocated fixed time slices for execution, cycling through the queue.

* Priority Scheduling: Tasks are assigned priorities, and the highest-priority task is executed.

* Fair Share Scheduling: Resources are allocated based on user-defined shares or resource limits, ensuring fairness among tasks.

* Deadline-Based Scheduling: Tasks are executed based on their specified deadlines. Real-time systems often use this to ensure that tasks meet their timing requirements.

Scheduling algorithms play a vital role in optimizing resource utilization and ensuring efficient task execution across various computing domains. The choice of algorithm depends on specific requirements and characteristics of the system and the tasks being scheduled.
