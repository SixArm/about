# Long-term orientation versus short-term orientation

Long-term orientation versus short-term orientation is one of six cultural dimensions described by cross-cultural researcher Geert Hofstede. It reflects the extent to which a culture emphasizes planning, perseverance, and tradition versus immediacy, gratification, and flexibility.

* Long-Term Orientation (LTO): Long-term orientation refers to a cultural dimension that reflects a society's values regarding time, perseverance, and long-term planning. Cultures with a high long-term orientation emphasize long-term goals, thriftiness, perseverance, and a focus on the future. They value traditions, have a propensity for saving and investing in education, and exhibit a preference for delayed gratification. These cultures often emphasize virtues such as persistence, adaptability, and preparing for the future.

* Short-Term Orientation (STO): Short-term orientation reflects a cultural dimension that emphasizes immediate gratification, quick results, and a focus on the present. Cultures with a high short-term orientation prioritize immediate needs and rewards over long-term planning. They tend to have less emphasis on tradition and value flexibility, adaptability, and living for the present moment. These cultures may have a lower propensity for saving and exhibit a greater emphasis on immediate gratification and personal stability.

The dimension can help individuals and organizations gain insights into cultural differences related to time orientation, goal-setting, and planning horizons. Understanding these dimensions can assist in navigating cross-cultural interactions, decision-making processes, and adapting communication styles to effectively engage with individuals from different cultural backgrounds.
