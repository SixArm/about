# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction and data analysis technique commonly used in machine learning and statistics. PCA transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation, by identifying and projecting the data onto a new set of orthogonal axes called principal components. PCA is useful for dimensionality reduction, feature transformation, data visualization, noise reduction, and lossy compression.

Stepsâ€¦

* Data Preparation: Begin with a dataset containing 'n' data points, each represented by 'm' features (dimensions). The data is typically standardized or normalized to ensure that each feature has a similar scale.

* Compute Mean: Calculate the mean vector for the entire dataset. This mean vector will serve as the center of the data.

* Calculate Covariance Matrix: Compute the covariance matrix of the standardized data. The covariance matrix captures the relationships between different features and provides information about the data's variability.

* Calculate Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues: Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Eigenvectors represent the directions along which the data varies the most, and eigenvalues quantify the amount of variance along these directions.

* Sort Eigenvalues: Sort the eigenvalues in decreasing order. The corresponding eigenvectors are also arranged accordingly.

* Select Principal Components: Choose the top 'k' eigenvectors based on the highest eigenvalues. These eigenvectors represent the principal components of the data.

* Project Data: Create a new matrix by projecting the original data onto the selected 'k' principal components. This new matrix will have reduced dimensions while preserving as much variance as possible.
