# Quadratic substring search algorithm

A quadratic substring search algorithm is a simple and straightforward approach to find all occurrences of a substring within a longer text string. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the text.

It's important to note that this algorithm is inefficient for large texts and patterns. More efficient string searching algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt or Boyer-Moore are recommended for practical applications involving large data.

Nevertheless, a quadratic algorithm can be useful for small text and pattern sizes or as a reference point for understanding more efficient algorithms.
