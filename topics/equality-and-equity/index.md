# Equality and equity

Equality and equity are two concepts that are often discussed in the context of fairness and social justice. While they share similarities, they have distinct meanings:

Equality refers to treating everyone the same and providing equal opportunities and resources to all individuals, regardless of their circumstances or needs. It focuses on ensuring that everyone is given equal access to the same resources, benefits, and opportunities without any discrimination. In the context of equality, fairness is achieved by treating everyone equally, regardless of any existing disparities or differences.

Equity, on the other hand, recognizes that individuals have different circumstances, needs, and starting points. It involves providing resources and opportunities to individuals in a way that accounts for these differences and aims to achieve fairness by addressing and correcting existing disparities. Equity focuses on distributing resources and opportunities in a manner that accounts for historical disadvantages or systemic barriers, aiming to level the playing field and provide each individual with what they need to succeed.

To illustrate the difference between equality and equity, consider the example of a group of people trying to watch a sports game over a fence. Equality would mean giving everyone the same-sized box to stand on, regardless of their height. While this approach may seem fair, it doesn't consider the fact that some individuals may still struggle to see over the fence due to their height. Equity, on the other hand, would involve providing different-sized boxes to individuals based on their height, ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to see the game.

In summary, equality focuses on providing the same treatment and opportunities to all individuals, while equity acknowledges and addresses existing disparities by providing resources and opportunities in a way that is responsive to individuals' unique circumstances and needs. Both concepts aim to achieve fairness, but equity takes into account the varying starting points and challenges faced by individuals in order to create a more just and inclusive society.
