# Bradford-Hill criteria

The Bradford-Hill criteria are a set of guidelines used to assess the strength of evidence for causality in epidemiology and public health research. They were proposed by the British epidemiologist Sir Austin Bradford Hill in 1965.

The Bradford-Hill criteria are as followsâ€¦

Strength of Association: A strong and consistent association between the exposure and the outcome increases the likelihood of a causal relationship.

Consistency: The relationship between the exposure and the outcome should be observed consistently in different studies, populations, and settings.

Specificity: A specific exposure should lead to a specific outcome, although this criterion is not always met in complex diseases with multiple risk factors.

Temporality: The exposure should precede the outcome in time, indicating a cause-effect relationship.

Biological Gradient (Dose-Response Relationship): There should be a dose-response relationship, meaning that higher levels of exposure increase the risk of the outcome.

Plausibility: The relationship between the exposure and the outcome should be biologically plausible, based on existing knowledge and understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

Coherence: The findings should be coherent with existing knowledge and consistent with known biological or epidemiological patterns.

Experimental Evidence: Experimental studies, such as randomized controlled trials, provide stronger evidence for causality than observational studies.

Analogy: Similarities with other established causal relationships may strengthen the evidence for causality.
