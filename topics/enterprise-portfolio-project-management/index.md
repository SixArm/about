# Enterprise Portfolio Project Management (EPPM)

Enterprise Portfolio Project Management (EPPM) is a methodology that helps organizations manage their project portfolios in a more efficient and strategic manner. EPPM focuses on aligning projects with the organization's goals and objectives, and ensuring that resources are allocated appropriately to achieve those goals.

**Stages:**

1. **Project identification and prioritization**: Identify all potential projects, and evaluate them based on strategic fit, potential ROI, and other relevant factors.

2. **Resource allocation**: Allocate resources to the prioritized projects in a manner that maximizes ROI and strategic alignment.

3. **Risk management**: Identify and manage risks associated with individual projects, as well as with the total portfolio.

4. **Performance tracking**: Track and report on the performance of individual projects and the total portfolio. This allows stakeholders to monitor progress and make informed decisions.

5. **Continuous improvement**: Gather feedback from stakeholders, to refine the portfolio management approach and improve project outcomes over time.

EPPM is particularly useful for large organizations with complex project portfolios. By taking a more strategic approach to portfolio management, EPPM helps organizations make better use of their resources and achieve their strategic objectives more efficiently.
