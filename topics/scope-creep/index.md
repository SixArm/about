# Scope creep

Scope creep, also known as feature creep or requirement creep, is a term used in project management and software development to describe the uncontrolled and gradual expansion of a project's scope beyond its initial objectives and requirements. It occurs when new features, requirements, or changes are added to the project without proper evaluation or consideration of their impact on the project timeline, resources, and budget.

Scope creep can arise due to various reasons, such asâ€¦

* Unclear Requirements: Incomplete or poorly defined initial requirements can lead to additional features being requested as the project progresses.

* Changing Priorities: Stakeholders' priorities and preferences may shift during the project, leading to new features being introduced.

* Lack of Communication: Insufficient communication between stakeholders, project managers, and development teams can result in misunderstandings and changes in requirements.

* Evolving User Expectations: As users interact with early project deliverables, they may provide feedback that leads to requests for additional features or changes.

* Scope Creep by Incremental Additions: Small changes or additions, individually appearing minor, can collectively lead to significant scope expansion.

The consequences of scope creep can be detrimental to the project's success: delays, budget overruns, reduced quality, and team frustration.

To manage scope creep effectively, project managers and teams should establish change control processes, prioritize tasks, and increase stakeholder involvement.
