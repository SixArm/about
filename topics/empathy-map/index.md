# Empathy map

The empathy map is a tool used in User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design to gain a deeper understanding of users and their needs. It helps designers and product teams develop empathy by putting themselves in the users' shoes and gaining insights into their thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and motivations.

The empathy map consists of a simple framework that is divided into four quadrants, each focusing on a different aspect of the user's experience:

* Say: This quadrant captures the user's spoken or written statements. It includes direct quotes, feedback, or any specific phrases the user has expressed. These statements provide insights into the user's needs, desires, and expectations.

* Think: In this quadrant, designers capture the user's thoughts and internal dialogue. It involves identifying the underlying beliefs, assumptions, and thoughts that drive the user's behavior. Understanding what users are thinking helps in designing solutions that align with their cognitive processes.

* Do: This quadrant focuses on the user's observable behaviors, actions, and interactions. It involves observing how users physically interact with a product, system, or interface. Identifying patterns of behavior helps designers uncover pain points, frustrations, or areas where the user might need guidance or support.

* Feel: This quadrant explores the user's emotions and feelings. It involves understanding the user's fears, frustrations, desires, and aspirations related to the product or service. By empathizing with users' emotions, designers can create experiences that resonate and positively impact their overall satisfaction.
