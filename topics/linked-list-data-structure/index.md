# Linked list data structure

A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science used for organizing and managing a collection of elements, often referred to as nodes. Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations, linked lists use pointers to connect the elements together. Each node contains both the data it holds and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

Linked lists provide dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions and deletions at any position, but they don't offer constant-time random access like arrays. Linked lists are commonly used when elements need to be added or removed frequently, or when the size of the list may change dynamically.

Here are the key components and characteristics of linked lists:

* Node: Each node in a linked list consists of two main components:
* * Data: The actual value or information that the node holds.
* * Next Pointer: A reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence. For the last node in the list, this pointer typically points to null to indicate the end of the list.

* Types of Linked Lists:
* * Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node in the sequence.
* * Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next node and the previous node in the sequence.
* * Circular Linked List: A variation of a linked list in which the last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.

* Operations:
* * Insertion: Adding a new node to the list, either at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end.
* * Deletion: Removing a node from the list by adjusting pointers to bypass the node.
* * Traversal: Iterating through the list to access or manipulate its elements.
* * Searching: Locating a specific element within the list.

* Advantages:
* * Dynamic Memory Allocation: Linked lists can grow or shrink as needed without requiring contiguous memory.
* * Efficient Insertions and Deletions: Adding or removing elements at any position is efficient compared to arrays.
* * Flexible Size: Linked lists can accommodate varying numbers of elements.

* Limitations:
* * Lack of Random Access: Accessing an element at a specific index requires traversing the list from the beginning.
* * Additional Memory Overhead: Each node requires extra memory for the next pointer, making linked lists less memory-efficient than arrays for storing the same data.

Linked lists are used in various scenarios, such as implementing data structures like stacks, queues, and hash tables, as well as for memory management in programming languages. They provide valuable solutions when dynamic allocation and efficient insertions or deletions are essential.
