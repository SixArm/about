# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and widely used machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It falls under the category of instance-based learning or lazy learning algorithms. KNN makes predictions by finding the 'k' training examples (data points) that are closest in distance to a given query point and then using the labels or values of those 'k' neighbors to make predictions for the query point.

KNN is often used as a baseline algorithm due to its simplicity, and it can be effective in scenarios where data is well-clustered or there are clear decision boundaries. However, more advanced algorithms like support vector machines, decision trees, and neural networks often outperform KNN on complex tasks.

Stepsâ€¦

* Data Preparation: The algorithm requires a dataset with labeled examples. Each example consists of a set of features (attributes) and a corresponding class label (for classification) or a target value (for regression).

* Choosing K: You need to specify the number of neighbors 'k' to consider when making predictions. This can be done through experimentation or by using techniques like cross-validation to find the optimal value of 'k'.

* Distance Metric: A distance metric, such as Euclidean distance, is used to measure the similarity or dissimilarity between data points in the feature space. The choice of distance metric depends on the nature of the data and the problem.

* Prediction for Classification: For a classification task, when given a new query point, KNN identifies the 'k' nearest neighbors from the training dataset based on the chosen distance metric. It then counts the occurrences of each class among these neighbors and assigns the class label with the highest count to the query point.

* Prediction for Regression: For a regression task, KNN calculates the average or weighted average of the target values of the 'k' nearest neighbors and uses this value as the prediction for the query point.

* Final Decision: Once the prediction is made, the algorithm outputs the predicted class label (for classification) or the predicted target value (for regression).
